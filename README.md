This is a simple web app built with NextJS designed to review phrases. Data is sourced from my personal collection of phrases that I've come across in my daily life. The app is intended to be used in a "flashcard" style, where the user on PC can press the spacebar or arrow keys to move across phrases, and on mobile can swipe left or right to do the same.
